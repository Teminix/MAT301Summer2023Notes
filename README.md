# MAT301Summer2023Notes

This is the repository for the volunteer note taking for MAT301H5Y taught in summer 2023. The notes are PDF's for each lecture which you can find in the respective week and can just manually download. You can also pull changes by cloning the repository if you know what you're doing.

 If I need to make edits I will commit the changes. Feel free to open an issue if you find something that needs to be addressed.
